To Create a player movement using pawn, collectible, player health and score.

## Procedure To Create and Destroy the coin:

Create a Blueprint Class based on Character (e.g., BP_PlayerCharacter).

On BeginOverlap with player:
Destroy the collectable.
Call a custom event or function on the player to increment score or health.
3. Implement Health System
In BP_PlayerCharacter, add a Health variable (e.g., float, default: 100).
Create a TakeDamage function to subtract from Health.
Optionally, implement logic to handle 0 health (e.g., death or respawn).
4. Implement Score System
Add a Score variable (int) in BP_PlayerCharacter.
When a collectable is picked up, increase the score.
Display score using UMG Widget:
Create a Widget Blueprint (e.g., W_HUD).
Add Text Blocks bound to Health and Score variables.
5. Setup Game Mode
Create a new Game Mode Blueprint.
Set BP_PlayerCharacter as the default pawn.
Set the HUD widget in the Game Modeâ€™s BeginPlay using Create Widget and Add to Viewport.
